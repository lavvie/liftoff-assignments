## Submission Instructions

### Overview
      I am developing a project to help people keep track of thier makeup. It is easy to use cosmetics past the expiration date, this can lead to skin issues and makeup not performing as it should. This app will also allow the individual to keep track of inventory, rate the item, wish list, description, cost, and crate shopping list. 
      What prompt me to design this app was my own experiences with makeup and the issues I have encountered. I have not encountered any apps that address my needs. 

### Features
      * User login- User will be allowed to log in to create a database.
      * Shopping link- User will be allowed to link a website of purchase to the database
      * Photo- User will be able to upload a picture of themselves, the color, etc.
      * Automatic expiration dates- Users will not have to know when various makeup expire, it will set it    
         automatically
 
### Technologies
      * Java
      * Spring Boot
      * MySQL
      * Bootstrap
      * Template (to be explored)

### What I'll Have to Learn
      * I will be exploring front end development, other than Thymeleaf. I still have to review the various 
         templates, possibly looking into react.
      * The other features of this app will be beyond anything that I have developed thus far. 
      * I am also looking into utilizing API's.
